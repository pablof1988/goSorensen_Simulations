# goSorensen_Simulations 
This repository contains all the R Script to obtain the simulation results described in the paper "An equivalence test between features lists, based on the Sorensen - Dice index and the joint frequencies of GO node enrichment"
d0_2857 folder, contains the simulations to ensure Sorensen test works adequately when equivalence limit is d0 = 0.2857
d0_4444 folder, contains the simulations to ensure Sorensen test works adequately when equivalence limit is d0 = 0.4444
asympthotic_Vs_Bootstrap_Simulations folder, contains the simulations to compare the power curves of the two approaches: asymptotic normal and bootstrap
